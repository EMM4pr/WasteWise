# WasteWise

Welcome to my project WasteWise!

## Overview

WasteWise is a cutting-edge mobile application developed by a collaborative team of four during our immersive experience at Le Wagon. The app harnesses the power of the Google Lens API to simplify waste management, making it easier for users to categorize waste items and find the nearest disposal locations.

## Features

### 1. Effortless Categorization
WasteWise streamlines the waste categorization process with a simple click or image search. The app uses the Google Lens API to swiftly identify and categorize various waste items.

### 2. Location-based Disposal
Discover the most convenient waste disposal locations near you. WasteWise helps users make environmentally conscious choices by providing information on the nearest disposal options.

### 3. Rewards for Sustainability
Beyond waste management, WasteWise promotes sustainable living. Users are rewarded for their responsible actions, encouraging them to contribute to a cleaner, greener future.
